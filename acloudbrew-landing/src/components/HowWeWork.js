      <ol>
        <li><strong>Discovery & Kickoff</strong><br />We start with a deep dive into your goals, challenges, and vision. Whether it's a full build or a focused consulting project, we'll align on scope, stack, and priorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Roadmapping & Setup</strong><br />We design a roadmap tailored to your timeline and needs. We set up infrastructure, repos, pipelines, and anything else needed to kickstart development right.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterative Development</strong><br />We ship in sprints, communicate openly, and constantly refine. You'll get demos, deliverables, and full visibility‚Äîno black boxes, ever.</li>
        <li><strong>Launch & Scale</strong><br />Once everything's ready, we deploy with confidence and support your growth. Need to optimize, scale, or add features? We're already one step ahead.</li>
